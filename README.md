# Air-Canvas
An Air Canvas is a revolutionary program enabling users to craft digital drawings through intuitive air gestures. Harnessing advanced motion-sensing technology, it transforms subtle movements into visually stunning creations on the screen, providing a unique and precise avenue for digital artistic expression.


This project draws inspiration from a GitHub repository centered around "air canvas using ML." The primary objective is to empower users to create virtual drawings in the air, with the system replicating their gestures on the output screen. The project leverages the capabilities of the MediaPipe library, an open-source framework developed by Google. MediaPipe enables the construction of pipelines for performing computer vision inference on diverse sensory data, such as video or audio.


Key Technologies:

MediaPipe Library: Used for building pipelines to execute computer vision tasks based on user gestures and interactions.
OpenCV: Employed for computer vision functionalities, providing a versatile set of tools for image and video processing.
NumPy: Utilized for efficient numerical operations, particularly in handling and manipulating arrays.


Features:

Air Drawing: Users can draw in the air using their pointing finger as a reference, and the system replicates the drawn patterns on the output screen.
Color Options: The project offers four color choices (red, blue, green, yellow), providing users with a range of creative possibilities.
Clear Option: A 'Clear' feature allows users to reset the canvas, essentially restarting the drawing process.
Quit Option: The program includes a 'Quit' option for users to exit the application when they have completed their drawing session.
By combining these technologies, the project provides an interactive and visually engaging experience, merging the physical act of drawing with the capabilities of machine learning.


Usage:

Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries using the provided dependencies.
Run the main script to launch the application.
Choose colors, draw in the air, clear the canvas, and quit the program when finished.


Dependencies:

MediaPipe
OpenCV
NumPy
